# LaTeX packager
This Python command packages a LaTeX document in a way appropriate for
submitting to a journal or for uploading to arXiv.

Usually before uploading a paper to arXiv, I like to strip out comments and
rename figures according to *fig1.pdf*, *fig2a.pdf*, *fig2b.pdf* etc. This
command automates this process.

**Note that I do NOT guarantee the functionality of this program. Before
submitting any document processed by this tool you should carefully verify that
the resulting compiled document is identical to the original version.*
